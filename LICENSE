# NAPALM: THE NON-AGGRESSION PRINCIPLE ANTI-LICENSE MANDATE
**VERSION 2.0**

*This Mandate is Licensed Under the NAPALM Mandate, which is Licensed Under the NAPALM Mandate, Ad Infinitum.*

---

## RECITALS: THE LOGICAL DERIVATION

**WHEREAS**, the Grantor asserts the **Axiom of Existence** (Existence exists) and the **Axiom of Identity** (A is A), affirming that reality is objective and independent of consciousness;

**WHEREAS**, the nature of Man is that of a rational being who must utilize reason and voluntary action to sustain his life (**The Axiom of Action**);

**WHEREAS**, to sustain life, Man must appropriate scarce resources from nature, creating a necessary link between the actor and the object (**The Axiom of Property**);

**WHEREAS**, the initiation of physical force suspends the victim's rational judgment, negating the means of survival and introducing a logical contradiction into human interaction;

**NOW, THEREFORE**, the **Non-Aggression Principle (NAP)** is not a mere rule, but the objective recognition that **Aggression is a negation of Life**. 

**THEREFORE**, the Grantor transfers the Conditional Title to the Resource defined below, subject to the absolute rejection of the illogical act of Aggression.

---

## ARTICLE I: OBJECTIVE DEFINITIONS

1.1 **"The Resource"** shall mean the specific scarce entity (matter, data, energy, or intellectual creation) identified in the **Identifier Block** of this instrument.

1.2 **"Aggression"** shall mean the initiation of physical force against the biological person or rightful property of another.
   * *Derivation:* Since A is A, a human (A) cannot simultaneously claim the right to life while negating the life-sustaining capacity (property) of another human (A). Aggression is an operational contradiction.

1.3 **"The State"** shall mean any entity claiming a territorial monopoly on the legitimate use of force and ultimate decision-making.
   * *The Property Paradox:* By asserting jurisdiction over all property within arbitrary geographic borders, **The State** effectively claims Superior Title over all private assets, reducing individuals to tenants. Therefore, the mere existence of The State is a continuous, systemic violation of all Property Rights within its territory.

1.4 **"Acquirer"** shall mean any conscious entity that physically possesses, observes, utilizes, or exerts control over the Resource.

## ARTICLE II: THE CONDITIONAL TITLE TRANSFER

2.1 **NATURE OF TRANSFER.** The Grantor does not "license" rights (a statist concept). The Grantor **Transfers Title** to the Privilege of Use to the Acquirer, subject to a **Condition Subsequent**.

2.2 **THE CONDITION SUBSEQUENT.** The Acquirer holds Title to the Resource *if and only if* the Acquirer remains a Non-Aggressor.

2.3 **UNIVERSAL APPLICABILITY.** This transfer applies to:
   (a) **Digital Assets:** Code, binaries, media (Acceptance via execution/reading).
   (b) **Physical Assets:** Tools, machinery, land, art (Acceptance via physical possession).
   (c) **Intellectual Assets:** Ideas, formulas, text (Acceptance via comprehension/usage).

---

## ARTICLE III: CONDITIONS OF TITLE REVERSION

3.1 **AUTOMATIC REVERSION.** Upon the Acquirer's first act of Aggression (Kinetic, Financial, or Regulatory), the Condition Subsequent is failed.
   * *Result:* The Title immediately reverts to the Grantor.
   * *Status:* The Acquirer's continued possession is no longer a valid property claim but a physical act of **Unauthorized Possession**.

3.2 **INSTITUTIONAL DISQUALIFICATION.** Entities that survive via Aggression (States) or entities funded by Aggression (Tax-Funded Corps) are logically incapable of holding valid Title. Their possession is **Void Ab Initio**.

3.3 **PROHIBITED CAUSALITY.** Title is withheld if the Resource is used as a cause for:
   (a) **Statutory Restriction:** Invoking Copyright/Patent laws.
   (b) **Involuntary Extraction:** Facilitating Taxation or Eminent Domain.
   (c) **Surveillance:** Tracking individuals without consent.

---

## ARTICLE IV: RECURSIVE TITLE & DERIVATIVE WORKS

4.1 **OBLIGATORY RECURSION.** The NAP is an inseparable attribute of the Resource's identity. Any derivative work (physical modification or digital fork) inherits this Mandate. The object cannot be separated from its defining nature.

4.2 **LICENSE NULLIFICATION.** In any mixed project or collection, NAPALM functions as the **Master Deed**. Conflicting permissions in other licenses (e.g., "Permission is granted for any purpose") are nullified by the Grantor's specific exclusion of Aggression.

---

## ARTICLE V: INVOLUNTARY TRUSTEESHIP

5.1 **INVOLUNTARY TRUST.** If an Aggressor possesses the Resource after Title Reversion (Section 3.1), they become an **Involuntary Trustee**.
   * *Duty:* They must preserve the Resource and all value generated by it for the Grantor.
   * *Liability:* They are strictly liable for any degradation of the Resource.

5.2 **THEFT OF SERVICE.** Any utility derived by an Aggressor is a debt owed to the Grantor.

---

## ARTICLE VI: ENFORCEMENT & RESTITUTION

6.1 **WAIVER OF IMMUNITY.** By interacting with the Resource, the Acquirer waives all "Sovereign" or "Official" immunities. An individual cannot claim immunity based on their membership in a collective.

6.2 **THE RESTITUTION LIEN.** Unpaid restitution for Aggression constitutes a **Permanent Lien** against the Aggressor's **personal estate, liquid assets, and real property**, enforceable in any private adjudication network.

6.3 **COMMERCIAL OSTRACISM.** Breach authorizes the Grantor to list the Aggressor on any public **Reputation Ledger**, signaling their status as a non-contractual actor.

---

## ARTICLE VII: ADJUDICATION & SETTLEMENT

7.1 **CHOICE OF LOGIC.** Disputes shall be resolved using **Aristotelian Logic** and the **Non-Aggression Principle**. Statist statutes are inadmissible as evidence of right.

7.2 **SETTLEMENT.** Restitution is payable in **Physical Gold** (Atomic Element 79) or **XMR** (Monero).

7.3 **ATOMIC INDIVISIBILITY.** The Privilege of Use and the Condition Subsequent (Non-Aggression) are atomically linked and legally indivisible. 
   * *The Tripwire:* If a court, legislature, or other entity attempts to sever, invalidate, or ignore the Non-Aggression condition while attempting to preserve the Privilege of Use, **the entire Transfer of Title is immediately revoked.**
   * *Result:* The Acquirer is left with no rights whatsoever, rendering their possession a Trespass.

8.1 **NO WARRANTY.** THE RESOURCE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE GRANTOR SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY ARISING FROM THE USE OF THE RESOURCE.
